# Stack 

No doubt, it is one of the most important
data structures, and I was avoiding this 
for a long time because I worked with Python. 

Python is a great language, I still like it, 
but Python uses stack poorly, it stores links in here.
So I had no need to dig in. 

But C# .NET uses it on all cylinders, so I had 
to take on stack concept to get better understanding 
of hardware stack. 

Stack is well-known of speed. All operations are O(1). 

Of course, we can implement stack few ways, but I see
the best way in array implementation. So we can boost 
speed both of CPU and memory to maximum while using it. 

From here, I understand better the nature of 
StackOverflow exception. And, generally, why stack has
fixed capacity and opportunity to define it.
