### Here I study basic Data Sctructures, Algorithms and implementinting them via .NET C#

In this repository you can find computer science and logical basic constructs, which I implement via C# and share some thoughts in READMEs. 

Also I write unit-tests for those implementations, trying to get along with TDD (Test Driven Development). I find this way of code development fun and productive.
